        <h2>About</h2>

        <section>
          <p>The artist formerly known as Daniel Patrick Ellis is an American recording artist, actor and model.</p>

          <p>Ellis first came to prominence as a solo artist on Radio Disney and subsequently toured with Miley Cyrus and the Jonas Brothers.</p>

          <p>Following a series of stints on TV and in movies including CSI, Gossip Girl and Bad Santa, he has since taken a hiatus to complete a degree in broadcast journalism at the University of Miami.</p>

          <p>Currently, Dan is recording new music with international producer and DJ Tracy Young. He has left his squeaky-clean image behind for an edgier look that coincides with his new music which will be released in 2019.</p>
